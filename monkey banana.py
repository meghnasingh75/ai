# ALGORITHM:
# If the monkey is clever enough, he can come to the block, drag 
# the block to the center, climb on it, and get the banana. Below 
# are few observations in this case âˆ’ 
# 1. Monkey can reach the block, if both of them are at the same level. From the above 
# image, we can see that both the monkey and the block are on the floor. 
# 2. If the block position is not at the center, then the monkey can drag it to the center. 
# 3. If the monkey and the block both are on the floor, and the block is at the center, then 
# the monkey can climb up on the block. So the vertical position of the monkey will 
# be changed. 
# 4. When the monkey is on the block, and the block is at the center, then the monkey 
# can get the bananas.
